## Core Objectives

| Priority | Objective                                  | Success Metric                                   |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| P0       | {non negociable objectives}                | {measure of success}                             |
| P1       | {primary object, must have}                | {metrics should be measurable and provable}      |
| P2       | {secondary objective, can be deferred}     | {we should be able to track progress over time}  |
| P3       | {tertiary objective, nice to have}         |                                                  |

## Out of scope

The following list of features is explicitly out of scope of the project.
Community forks are absolutely welcome and encouraged to provide them, but it would take a very compelling argument to add them to the project.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list. Items may be added or removed as the project evolves.
